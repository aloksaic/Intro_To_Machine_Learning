# Machine_Learning
This is a portfolio for my CS 4375: Intro to Machine Learning class taken at UTD.

## Overview of ML
This [document](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is an overview of machine learning, which contains key terms and topics related to machine learning and my personal interest in this field.

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration
This portfolio is the first section in ML, which contains information regarding data analysis, and simulating built-in R functions in C++. Here is a [document](./Data_Exploration/C++_Data_Exploration.pdf), which contains an overview of what is covered in this section, along with a code snippet of the ouput from my [main](./Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp) C++ file for this assignment. 

## Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models
This portfolio is the second section in ML in which we cover Linear Regression and Classification/Logistic Regression. Here are the two R Notebooks ([regression](./Linear_Models/Regression.Rmd) and [classification](./Linear_Models/Classification.Rmd)) and their respective pdfs ([regression_pdf](./Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) and [classification_pdf](./Linear_Models/Classification.pdf)) that my partner and I worked on to complete this project. In each rmd file, we used two different datasets to complete given tasks for data exploration and modeling. Along with the models and data functions, we have a couple of interweaved explanations that go into further discussion of what the models and code represent.

## Portfolio Component 3: ML Algorithms from Scratch
This portfolio is the third section in ML in which we implemented two machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) from scratch using C++. This [program](./Algorithms_from_Scratch/LogReg.cpp) contains the code for creating a Logistic Regression model and this [program](./Algorithms_from_Scratch/NaiveBayes.cpp) creates a Naive Bayes model from scratch. Read this [overview document](./Algorithms_from_Scratch/ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf) to learn more about both of these programs.

## Portfolio Component 4: Searching for Similarity
This portfolio is the fourth section in ML in which we explored new methods of regression and classification, which include kNN and Decision Trees. On top of that, we also dived a little bit into Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction, which includes the techniques PCA and LDA. Here are the four R notebooks, for [regression](./Searching_for_Similarity/Regression.Rmd), [classification](./Searching_for_Similarity/Classification.Rmd), [clustering](./Searching_for_Similarity/Clustering.Rmd), and [dimensionality_reduction](./Searching_for_Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.Rmd), along with their respective pdfs ([regression_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Regression.pdf), [classification_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Classification.pdf), [clustering_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Clustering.pdf), and [dimensionality_reduction_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf)) that my partner and I worked on for this project. The datasets we used were the same datasets that we used in the project from portoflio component 2.
