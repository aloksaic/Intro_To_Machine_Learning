# Machine_Learning
This is a portfolio for my CS 4375: Intro to Machine Learning class taken at UTD.

## Overview of ML
This [document](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is an overview of machine learning, which contains key terms and topics related to machine learning and my personal interest in this field.

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration
This portfolio is the first section in ML, which contains information regarding data analysis, and simulating built-in R functions in C++. Here is a [document](./Data_Exploration/C++_Data_Exploration.pdf), which contains an overview of what is covered in this section, along with a code snippet of the ouput from my [main](./Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp) C++ file for this assignment. 

## Portfolio Component 2: Linear Models
This portfolio is the second section in ML in which we cover Linear Regression and Classification/Logistic Regression. Here are the two R Notebooks ([regression](./Linear_Models/Regression.Rmd) and [classification](./Linear_Models/Classification.Rmd)) and their respective pdfs ([regression_pdf](./Linear_Models/Regression.pdf) and [classification_pdf](./Linear_Models/Classification.pdf)) that my partner and I worked on to complete this project. In each rmd file, we used two different datasets to complete given tasks for data exploration and modeling. Along with the models and data functions, we have a couple of interweaved explanations that go into further discussion of what the models and code represent.

## Portfolio Component 3: ML Algorithms from Scratch
This portfolio is the third section in ML in which we implemented two machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) from scratch using C++. This [program](./Algorithms_from_Scratch/LogReg.cpp) contains the code for creating a Logistic Regression model and this [program](./Algorithms_from_Scratch/NaiveBayes.cpp) creates a Naive Bayes model from scratch. Read this [overview document](./Algorithms_from_Scratch/ML_Algorithms_from_Scratch.pdf) to learn more about both of these programs.

## Portfolio Component 4: Searching for Similarity
This portfolio is the fourth section in ML in which we explored new methods of regression and classification, which include kNN and Decision Trees. On top of that, we also dived a little bit into Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction, which includes the techniques PCA and LDA. Here are the four R notebooks, for [regression](./Searching_for_Similarity/Regression.Rmd), [classification](./Searching_for_Similarity/Classification.Rmd), [clustering](./Searching_for_Similarity/Clustering.Rmd), and [dimensionality_reduction](./Searching_for_Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.Rmd), along with their respective pdfs ([regression_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Regression.pdf), [classification_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Classification.pdf), [clustering_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Clustering.pdf), and [dimensionality_reduction_pdf](./Searching_for_Similarity/Dimensionality_Reduction.pdf)) that my partner and I worked on for this project. The datasets we used were the same datasets that we used in the project from portoflio component 2.

## Portfolio Component 5: Kernel and Ensemble Methods
In this assignment, we performed machine learning on regression and classification datasets using SVM kernels and Ensemble techniques. This [report](./Kernel_and_Ensemble_Methods/Narrative.pdf) discusses SVM, the three types of kernels in SVM (linear, polynomial, and radial), and the ensemble techniques (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Adabag) used in this portfolio. The first [notebook](./Kernel_and_Ensemble_Methods/Regression.pdf) compares the results from using linear, polynomial, and radial SVM kernels on a regression dataset. The second [notebook](./Kernel_and_Ensemble_Methods/Classification.pdf) compares the results of using the three SVM kernels on a classification dataset. The third [notebook](./Kernel_and_Ensemble_Methods/Ensemble.pdf) conducts classification using Random Forest. XGBoost, and Adabag and compares the results to the Decision Tree algorithm.

## Portfolio Component 6: ML with sklearn
In this portfolio assignment, we gained some experience working with the sklearn library in Python to explore a small data set. This [pdf](./ML_with_sklearn/ml_with_sklearn.pdf) shows the work that was done with the three different classification algorithms from the sklearn library. 

## Portfolio Component 7: Image Classification
In this portfolio assignment, we worked with Keras for image classification and looked at different neural networks, specifically the reccurrent neural network (RNN). We gained experience with Tensorflow and deep learning models. This [pdf](./Image_Classification.pdf) shows the work that was done on Google Colab with image classification.
