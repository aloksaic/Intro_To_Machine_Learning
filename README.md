# Machine_Learning
This is a portfolio for my CS 4375: Intro to Machine Learning class taken at UTD.

## Overview of ML
This [document](Overview_of_ML.pdf) is an overview of machine learning, which contains key terms and topics related to machine learning and my personal interest in this field.

## Portfolio Component 1: Data Exploration
This portfolio is the first section to ML, which contains information regarding data analysis, and simulating built-in R functions in C++. Here is a [document](./C++_Data_Exploration/C++_Data_Exploration.pdf), which contains an overview of what is covered in this section, along with a code snippet of the ouput from my [main](./C++_Data_Exploration/data_exploration.cpp) C++ file for this assignment.
